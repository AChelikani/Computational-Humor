It's time for a spooky Halloween contest.,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunkencookery/comments/5865y8/its_time_for_a_spooky_halloween_contest/,I am trying to decide what booze I can drink that won't immediately come flying back up once candycorns hit my tongue,First place should be free fake tits.,So if we throw together something that turns out to taste like death or burns catastrophically, but was made of food ingredients, then can it still be entered? Only asking because I'm new to the sub and haven't personally tried cooking while drunk yet.,Can we enter more than once?  I have a few ideas.,I know as a moderator that I can't participate, but can my friend Buortton participate?
Chicken a la King?,http://imgur.com/a/zNjRT,Natural Ice.    You sir are a true savage.  Current me is wincing,  but my younger and much poorer contemporary nods in approval.,Fuck yeah natty ice.,Looks dank,Wait, that's a real dish? Not just a throwaway line from Aladdin?,I thought those peppers were candy corn for a second.
Wine Newbie + Shiraz = Drunken Andouille Soup,http://imgur.com/a/Bevdo,Hahahaha.  Awesome fucking post man!,/r/food and the like are fun for really pristine, pretty pictures of perfectly-prepared (damn that's a lot of p's) recipes, and that's great and all for just ogling. But what I love about this sub is that it gets down and dirty and yeah, when you're cooking at home, this is what it ends up looking like most of the time. 10/10 post I love it and also I'm just in a generally happy mood right now i luv u op,looks yummy my dude. where did u get those speakers tho?,I really dig the tub of lard in your cabinet, it's a good touch. You go hard.,a thank at yuo
Sorry I didn't take a picture of the 10 shots I took but here's the end result,http://imgur.com/JOdZOmU,You don't gotta prove you're drunk here. We assume the drunkeness.,It's like that bun is a black person and you're a city cop.,Looks like its topped with a turd,For 10 shots, that's fairly ok.,Looks glorious
Thought the "pizza taco" would be a good idea. It was.,http://imgur.com/5aas2eG,not enough cheese,Were you wrong?,Try that with a flour tortilla next time.  You will never go back.,OR:  Only lightly fry the tortillas, slap a fried egg on each, replace the tomato sauce with the salsa of your choice, top with cheese.  Into the oven (or microwave) to melt the cheese and call it Huevos Rancheros.,add mushrooms.
Made one of my favorites - white mushroom lasagne. Thank you vodka for being my sous chef.,http://imgur.com/a/ZeWpf,"I'd like to thank Vodka for being my sous-chef" should be our sub's motto on the sideboard.,That looked really good, and the gnome was definitely unsettling. What do you mean add egg though? Just whisk them and pour as a layer? I really want to make this,Y'know what would really put that over the top? Some pulled smoked chicken.,Wow looks fucking rad.... I'm a monster and I'd love brown mushroom gravy all over this.,Would you not want to use the porcini water in some way too, to concentrate that mushroom flavour? Maybe stirred into the bechemel sauce instead of some of the milk?
Smoked scallops and pasta.,https://imgur.com/gallery/AKpPE,Does it matter what colour my thong is?,I could cut carbyne with my food boner right now.,Fuck, I should do that next time...  Scallops are so goddamn good.,damn that looks amazing , i love fish,How much of a difference does cooking on the wood make? I've seen it done a few times and really want to try it out
I found a funny video on my dad's camera where he recorded himself drunk making a salt steak, so I edited it into a video.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b_6XUssoBs&feature=youtu.be,Jesus Christ, what is that cut?   That looks to be somewhere between 30-40+ lbs easily.  I've seen smaller bags of concrete.,the part that made me happiest was seeing this was probably from ontario, not the states.  good ol' toronto star,It ends too soon! I wanna see that bad boy all cut open.,I don't think I've ever seen that much mustard before.,I believe it was only a 22lb chuck roast

https://i.redd.it/2fh4juhcrvsx.jpg,~in the voice of Niles from Frasier~  "Tomato sauce in a cast iron pan?!"  But this looks so good!,You knew it would be a disaster but turned the heat on anyway. It's what any true drunken chef would do!,Homemade meatballs cooking in tomato sauce. I usually don't drink wine but I really enjoyed the cheap bottle of Pinot noir in the background,raw meatballs being simmered = boiled meat. yum.,I like how you can already see the sauce bulging a good amount above the rim of the pan, only held there by the surface tension. Takes some balls to turn on the stove anyway.
Pressure cooker cheddar/broccoli chicken.,http://i.imgur.com/S3AX6ZC.jpg,A pound of frozen chicken, with Campbells fat free condensed cheddar broccoli and a can of water.    Cooked it under poultry for 20, let it de-pressurize for 20. Added some cheese to undo the fat-free.    Amazing.    Also, drinking Luskova out of the freezer and Coors light.,Glad to see a pressure cooker used in this sub,Chicken in a pressure cooker...why,Is look of egg with peas. Now I want om'lette with peas.,That looks like shit.
It burned my mouth when I tried to drink it,https://i.reddituploads.com/cc150f0280bb4939903efd3ffa4633db?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=d900e1251bf9df675b9d688342019142,What is it?,...Are those roasted peanuts? ...in ramen? I sure hope it's ramen and not roasted peanut water.,shim ramyun, the good shit,Peanut soup...?,How do you do those eggs????
flamin hot mac and cheez,https://i.reddituploads.com/65e6dd781f4b4bf8bf001de8e141103e?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=dda3ea44f27655c678380ccf6334a084,i would eat the shit out of that,that's fuckin penne  why the hell is it so acceptable to swap out any pasta you want into a "mac" and cheese and still call it "mac"  just call it goddamn pasta and cheese  hey here's a cheeseburger it's just a slice of cheese and cucumber on bread  but dave wtf where's the burger oh I swapped it for cucumber but called it the same thing because that's acceptable in today's world,I need a recipe, like yesterday,That's not even a fair comparison. Macaroni and penne are both tubular noodles at least.  Besides, this is a drunk cooking thread, you really think after 8 beers I cared what kind of pasta I had in my cupboard?  Get over yourself.,Hot dogs are sandwiches
Beef neck bone with spices. Garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.,https://i.redd.it/jz5zynqy6gsx.jpg,As another person that tries to cook fancy shit while shit faced 10/10 bro. Great job.,Was there marrow to be sucked out of said bone?  Grace the taters witht hat shit.,This looks amazing! I like cooking fancy stuff after a few too. I also just love cooking in general. I just found this sub and it makes me so happy.,Thanks. I like cooking and being slightly intoxicated gives you a lot of freedom. I'll probably post pretty regularly so keep an eye out.,Unfortunately no. The bones had been cut in what they called diamond, basically in half.
